Description: This package prices convertible bonds and a
        variety of other financial derivatives. It uses an
        extension of the usual Black-Scholes model in which
        jump to default may occur at a probability specified
        by a power-law link between stock price and hazard
        rate as found in the paper by Takahashi, Kobayashi,
        and Nakagawa (2001).  We use ideas and techniques
        from Andersen and Buffum (2002) and Linetsky (2006).
