Description: This package prices convertible bonds and a
    variety of other financial derivatives. It uses an
    extension of the usual Black-Scholes model in which
    jump to default may occur at a probability specified
    by a power-law link between stock price and hazard
    rate as found in the paper by Takahashi, Kobayashi,
    and Nakagawa (2001).  We use ideas and techniques
    from Andersen and Buffum (2002) and Linetsky (2006).
